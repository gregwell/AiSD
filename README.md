# Algorithms and Data Structures

- the repository contains all files for assignments from fall 2019 Algorithms and Data Structures course

- all assignments solutions were written in C++

- Implemented algorithms and data structures:
    - Queue
        - array queue
        - pointer queue
    - Stack
        - array stack
        - pointer stack
    - List
    - Sorting algorithms
        - Bubble Sort
        - Comb Sort
        - Heap Sort
        - Insert Sort
        - Merge Sort
        - Quick Sort
            - Hoare
            - Lomuto
        - Selection Sort
        - Shell Sort
    - Binary Search Tree (BST)
    - Graphs
        - Breadth First Search (BFS)
        - Depth First Search (DFS)
